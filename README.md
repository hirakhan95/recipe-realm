# Recipe Realm

Recipe Realm is a Python terminal application that operates within the mock terminal of Heroku. Users can effectively 
manage recipes by viewing others', creating their own, updating them, and deleting them according to their specific 
needs. 

A hierarchical structure is maintained wherein only the admin has the privileges to perform all functionalities.
However, if the user is not an admin, they can only modify or delete their own recipes, ensuring the integrity of other 
users' recipes.

Credentials for admin is as follows:
